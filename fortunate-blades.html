<h1>Fortunate Blades</h1>

<h1>The Basics</h1>
<h2>The Game</h2>

<p>Heroic Blades is an epic fantasy game based on PBtA, Blades in the Dark, and OSR games.</p>

<p>Its goals are:</p>

<ul>
    <li>To run the sorts of games me and my players love; which are story-forward, wildly creative fantasy games with customizable characters, big dramatic fights, online-friendly rules, and fast-moving so a lot can happen every play session.</li>

    <li>To be really, really fun, and capture that &lsquo;chaotic random joy&rsquo; of a great Old-School RPG.</li>

    <li>To share the creation of the story and the setting between all players.</li>

    <li>To not require prep from the GM and players, and whatever prep they do voluntarily only helps.</li>

</ul>
<p>It&rsquo;s a fantasy RPG meant for busy grown-ups who love to create big crazy stories and modern RPG mechanics but don&rsquo;t get a lot of time to play.</p>

<h3>What You Need To Play</h3>

<p>Heroic Blades requires a full set of &lsquo;RPG&rsquo; dice to play along with paper and pencils.</p>

<p>There are Character, Party, and Forces sheets one can print out to help, and I&rsquo;ll be working on a Roll20 integration as well.</p>

<h3>The Setting</h3>

<p>This game was created to play fantasy campaigns, where the players are the main characters directly involved in a pivotal, critical moment happening in their corner of the world.</p>

<p>Unlike most Blades In The Dark styles games there is no predefined setting. In Heroic Blades you play to find out the setting, the peril it&rsquo;s in, and the world lore together, and each player gets to define the part of the world their character came from. It&rsquo;s purposely open-ended, with no setting, and made to support any sort of fantasy game setting you either purposely define ahead of time or decide to create on the fly through play.</p>

<p>First everyone gets a character, either by choosing what sort of character they would like to play or randomly generating one. Then they write down a few things about where that character came from and/or about their people, which become part of the backstory of the setting the game will take place in. </p>

<p>Then as a group you pick (or randomly roll for) how The Party of Heroes came to be, and where our story is going to start. Then as a group you pick (or randomly roll for) some of the major Forces that shape your world.</p>
<p>Then the GM picks (or randomly rolls for) what things are in Peril, and what Forces are behind it, and keeps these secrets from the players to be revealed over time through play.</p>

<p>Through play, the players and the GM collaboratively will build the world, its backstory, and the specific histories of the characters within it as they try to save it.</p>

<h3>The Players</h3>

<p>This game is for players that have a lot of fun with:</p>

<ul>
    <li>&ldquo;Yes, and&hellip;&rdquo; story-focused games.</li>

    <li>Fantastical settings that would look proper airbrushed on the side of a van.</li>

    <li>Larger story arcs for the PC&rsquo;s where they are the main characters in a pivotal, critical moment that&rsquo;s happening in their world.</li>

    <li>Collaborative World-building and player control over backstory.</li>
<li>High-stakes chaotic dramatic adventures, encounters, and fights as a team.</li>

    <li>Lots of interesting / flexible character building and character leveling options.</li>

</ul>
<p>This game isn&rsquo;t great for players that have a lot of fun with:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Simulationist &lsquo;crunchy&rsquo; detailed rule systems.</li>

    <li>Historically-accurate and/or low magic settings.</li>

    <li>Purely episodic or more &ldquo;one-shot&rdquo; style games with new characters every time.</li>

    <li>Predefined settings with deep lore.</li>

    <li>Slower but more tactically complex fights.</li>

    <li>PvP-heavy games with a focus on inter-character drama.</li>

    <li>Preset genre-specific roles, playbooks, or classes.</li>

</ul>
<h3>The Characters</h3>

<p>Characters are built using a combination of Attributes and Talents.</p>

<p>Attributes represent how good the character is at certain important Actions, such as Fighting monsters, Sneaking past guards, Studying magical scrolls, Noticing that the king is lying to them, or Corusing with local merchants to learn important facts. Attributes are added (or subtracted!) to Rolls made for doing things that are based on that Attribute. We&rsquo;ll go into more detail on Attributes later in their own section.</p>

<p>Talents are the specific things that only few can do that make your character more unique in our story. Things like the special training to wear heavy armor without it slowing you down, or a knack for noticing dangers in the dark, or the inherent ability to cast powerful spells. We&rsquo;ll also go into more detail about Talents later in their own section.</p>

<p>Attributes and Talents come from the Background you pick for the character, their chosen Trades, and from the magical item they carry, their Heroic Blade. As the characters progress, they can increase their Attributes, add more Talents, and/or gain more powers from their Heroic Blade, depending upon what has happened during play.</p>

<p>To create a Character, first you pick (or randomly roll for) two different elements of a character&rsquo;s background, each giving the character a minor Talent that also comes with some sort of minor downside. This sets where this Character comes from, what their heritage is, and a starting point for the backstory and tales the player of that character will share from their background. In Heroic Blades, it&rsquo;s up to the players to help define the world our story will take place in, and the things they say about their character&rsquo;s background become part of that story. These Backgrounds are set for the existence of that character, and new ones aren&rsquo;t gained through play.</p>

<p>Then you pick (or randomly roll for) a Trade, which gives the character a major starting Talent, which defines what special things they are able to do. This sets what this character is about now, what they are good at, and where they fit into our story. You then either pick another Talent within your starting Trade, or pick (or randomly roll for) a second Trade, and take its starting Talent instead. As they Progress through play, players pick more Talents from those Trades, or start a new Trade and possibly abandon an old one, depending upon the events that happened during play.</p>

<p>Then you create your Heroic Blade. This is a special magic item you start the game with and give a name and origin story for. It doesn&rsquo;t have to be a blade exactly, it can be anything you can think of that makes sense for your character to possess, but it does grant your character another Talent as long as they have it in their position and are able to use it properly.</p>

<p>Then, you select where to distribute the starting Attributes your character has, with their Background and Trade in mind (or not, it&rsquo;s up to you).</p>
<p>Then, you determine their Personal Quest. This is something personally important that this character wants to accomplish. It&rsquo;s chosen from a list, or randomly generated, or can be simply made up by the player when the character is created.</p>

<p>Give the character a name, a look, and you&rsquo;re ready to play!</p>

<h3>The Party</h3>

<p>Once you&rsquo;ve generated your characters, it&rsquo;s time to assemble the Party.</p>

<p>The Party is your team, your group, your company. As you complete Quests, it has a Reputation that will grow, unlocking new Party Talents all the characters gain.</p>

<p>To create one, the Players and the GM will work together to choose from a list, randomly roll for, or just make up an origin from a list of origins, a Party Quest, and a starting Reputation.</p>

<p>Origins are how the party met and formed, like did they come together to defeat a great evil? Or did they all survive some horrible monster attack? Or did they all break out of prison together, and now are on the run? What is the main thing that brought them together? While there is a list to pick from, or randomly roll on, this can just simply be made up as a group.</p>

<p>The Party Quest is the main thing this group of characters is trying to do together. Is it to get rich? Stop a great evil? Get vengeance on a king who betrayed them? Again, while there is a list to pick from, or randomly roll on, this also can simply be made up as a group.</p>

<p>Reputation is how your Party is perceived by the world in our story. It&rsquo;s type describe what sort of Party you are, such as noble, or vengeful, or murderous. There&rsquo;s a list to pick from, or randomly roll on, but this too can simply be made up as a group.</p>

<p>However, at the start, your rank will be zero. As you complete Quests, this rank will increase, as the Party earns Reputation Points with the various Forces that are in your world. At certain totals of these Reputation Points the Party will level up and gain a new rank.</p>

<p>As it does, special Party Talents will be unlocked at different ranks, and your Party can gain such things as henchmen, followers, noble titles, a grand ship, a trade charter, or even a castle that it can use to further its goals.</p>

<p>All of this can become the first Quest the players play through as an &lsquo;origin story&rsquo;, if so desired, where the GM &amp; Players set the Origin, and the Party Quest and starting Reputation is determined through play. Or you can simply jump into the story with all the characters already knowing each other, and with a purpose and reputation already established.</p>

<h3>The Forces</h3>

<p>Every story has its important Forces impacting the world it&rsquo;s set in. In Heroic Blades, at the start of a Campaign, the players and GM work together to define three to four starting Forces. These are things like great kingdoms, evil arch-demons, divine actors such as gods, raw elemental magical forces, or even concepts like poverty or servitude.</p>

<p>These Forces can be picked from a list, randomly generated, or simply made up together. A Force has a Magnitude that represents how powerful it is in your world, an Involvement that represents how much it directly interacts with your world, and an Ethic that represents its principles and possible goals.</p>

<p>As you play, the Party will earn Reputation Points with the various Forces by completing Quests. These points are neither positive or negative, so by doing good things against an evil Force will earn you Reputation Points with that evil Force, even though you&rsquo;re not working for that Force but against it. These points just represent how big of an impact the Party has been making on these Forces. It&rsquo;s possible with some Quests to earn Reputation Points with more than one Force at the same time, and larger more perilous Quests earn more points than smaller safer ones.</p>

<p>More Forces will be introduced through play, both by the GM and the players, depending on our story, the character&rsquo;s backstories, or the GM introducing a new threat. While it&rsquo;s best to have at least three to four known Forces, the GM can have any number of secret ones they will reveal through play.</p>

<p>One or more of these Forces will be actively trying to radically change the world the characters are in to where their lives will never be the same. The GM will secretly choose which Force or Forces are trying to do that, what their real Goals are, who they are acting through, and as the Campaign Clock advances, that will move closer to happening unless our Party stops it.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;ll go into creating Forces later in the book as well.</p>

<h3>The Game Master</h3>

<p>&lt;summary about the GM&gt;</p>

<h3>Playing The Game</h3>

<p>Once a group has made their Characters, assembled their Party, and decided what starting Forces there are in the world you&rsquo;re creating together, a game of Heroic Blades has &lsquo;phases&rsquo; of play.</p>

<p>The GM will present the players with one or more Quests, which the GM will either make up on their own, pick from a list of options, or randomly roll to generate. These Quests are made up of a series of Encounters. Just one or two encounters for a short Quest to five (or more!) for a Heroic Quest. The players will choose a Quest, and Free Play begins.</p>

<p>Adventuring represents the &lsquo;unstructured&rsquo; time that happens before an Encounter. Players can prepare, interact with each other or NPCs, work on their own Personal Quests, explore and research and investigate, etc. </p>

<p>Some actions taken during Adventuring might trigger something called a Roll, which is the central mechanic used in Heroic Blades to determine the outcome of any risky action the Player&rsquo;s characters may take. We&rsquo;ll talk about those in detail later.</p>

<p>In-game time during Adventuring can be fluid, too, with whatever best fits what&rsquo;s happening in the story. Free Play could represent months of travel, for example, or just an hour spent in the village before the Party carries on.</p>

<p>Once Free Play is over (by the choice of the players or the GM) the Encounter begins. The Encounter represents the really risky part of our story, where all the big action happens. While that can sometimes be a fight, it can also be a challenge where the characters have to get past a certain danger using cunning, finesse, or magic. It could even be a social challenge of some kind, like attending a royal ball. An Engagement Roll is made to see how good (or bad!) things are for the player&rsquo;s characters at the start of the Encounter, and we jump right into the action. Many Rolls are made while resolving how the Encounter goes, Group Actions can be made, direct consequences can be Resisted, Harm can befall the characters, and Fortune can be spent to reduce Harm, empower Talents, have Flashbacks, and/or add to Rolls. Things we&rsquo;ll go into more detail on later.</p>

<p>Once the Encounter is over, successful or not, the Players can choose to take a Rest, which represents the time that happens after an Encounter. Players can Loot, Recover, work on long-term projects, train, tell a story of their people, and more. We&rsquo;ll also look at these actions in detail later, but the players only pick two from a short list of Rest Actions they can take. This is the structured response the Players have after the Encounter is over.</p>
<p>Then once the Rest is over, Adventuring begins again, then it&rsquo;s onto the next Encounter, another Engagement Roll is made, and we repeat this pattern of Free Play - Encounter - Downtime until all the Encounters that make up the Quest are resolved one way or another.</p>

<p>Once the final Encounter is resolved for the current Quest, the Quest ends, Reputation is earned, rewards are given, Characters that have gained enough XP can level up, the Party itself can level up, and more. We&rsquo;ll also talk about The Quest&rsquo;s End in more detail below.</p>
<p>If the group wants to keep playing, this cycle then repeats, with the GM presenting new available Quests to the players. One of which is chosen, and the whole cycle begins again. As Quests are completed and both the Party and the Characters advance and level up, the GM also advances the Campaign Clock, which ups the stakes, brings in new threats, and reveals the cosmic forces that are behind the quickly approaching peril their world is in.</p>

<p>A few brief examples:</p>

<ul>
    <li>A group of traveling heroes has heard that a local village needs help, as nightly Dire Wolf attacks terrorize it, and has agreed to stop it (the Quest). </li>

    <li>They travel to the village, asking locals along the way about the wolves and learning important information about what&rsquo;s going on (Adventuring).</li>

    <li>They get to the village, and prepare for the night to come (more Adventuring), and when night falls the wolves attack (an Engagement Roll is made to see how well all this preparation worked out for our heroes, and the first Encounter starts!).</li>

    <li>Our heroes fight off the wolves (the encounter ends) and then rest until morning, keeping a wary watch, healing up, and training for the next attack (Rest activities).</li>

    <li>Investigating the wolf corpses the next morning, they see they have been warped by some great evil (Adventuring) and track the wolves back to their den in a cave (more Adventuring).</li>

    <li>They sneak into the cave to discover a cult of evil druids (a Force) have left a cursed artifact deep within the cave that has been twisting all the local wildlife in evil ways. But our heroes all have to cross a deep pit in the cave to get to the artifact, and the overgrown vines in the cave entry have come alive and try to push them into the pit (another Engagement roll, and another Encounter).</li>

    <li>Our heroes are successful in chopping through the vines, crossing the pit, and destroying the artifact without succumbing to its evil (the Encounter ends).</li>

    <li>Our heroes return to the village, victorious, and celebrate (Rest Activities) and the word of their deed spreads wide, as the evil druids plot their revenge (the Quest has concluded, Experience and Reputation is given, etc.). &nbsp; &nbsp;</li>

<h2>The Roll</h2>

<h3>When to make a Roll</h3>

<p>When the DM decides that a Character or the Party is doing something risky they will call for a Roll.</p>

<p>If there is no real risk, there is no need to make a Roll. The Player states what the Character is doing, and it just happens.</p>

<p>Only when there is a risk of something going wrong from what the Character is doing, or possible additional complications of some kind from their action, that a Roll should be made to see what happens. </p>

<h3>Calling for a Roll</h3>

<p>The DM will state the Risk that&rsquo;s triggering a Roll, or recommend a specific Attribute, and then ask the Player to &lsquo;Make a Roll&rsquo;. The Player will then say what Attribute they feel best suits how the Character is dealing with the risk, or what Attribute they would rather try and use, and what Talents and Fortune they might use as well. We&rsquo;ll talk more about Attributes, Talents, and Fortune later on, each in their own sections. But it&rsquo;s always the Player that gets to choose what Attribute, Talents, and Fortune they are using in the situation, regardless of what the GM might have originally asked for.</p>

<p>The DM then will choose target numbers based on the difficulty of avoiding risks for &ldquo;close&rdquo; and &ldquo;clear&rdquo;, such as &ldquo;10 for close, 15 for clear&rdquo;.</p>

<p>The player then rolls a D20, and adds and/or subtracts from it based upon the Attribute, Talents, and Fortune the Character is using. If they get equal to or over the Clear number, it&rsquo;s a Clear Success, and the risk passes without consequences. If they roll under the Clear number, but equal to or over the Close number, the character still avoids the obvious repercussions of the risk, but there are some consequences that the DM will determine. If you roll under the Close number, it doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean the character failed in some way, but it does mean the DM gets to now Make A Move and state the dire consequences that result from the risk fully impacting the Party.</p>

<p>These Close and Clear numbers are deemed by the DM based upon what&rsquo;s happening in the story and what Attribute and Talents the Player chose to apply, while guided by some typical ranges for different scenarios. Typically the DM will tell the players what these numbers are before the Player rolls, but they don&rsquo;t necessarily have to, they can keep it a secret to reveal after the Player rolls if so desired.</p>

<p>The DM can also upon their discretion tell the player ahead of a Roll how effective it will be if successful, and what consequences might befall them if not, and the Players can bargain with the DM to change tactics before the Roll is made if they feel the Close and Clear numbers are too high. The DM can also tell the player that applying a different Attribute and/or Talent might be easier, or offer a Hard Bargain where the Player might not even have to roll, but will have to make a difficult choice of some kind instead.</p>

<p>The range between Close and Clear can vary quite a bit depending on the DM&rsquo;s discretion on the situation. For example, something that&rsquo;s easy to do, but hard to avoid consequences for doing so (such as pickpocketing someone) the Close number might be rather low, and the Clear number fairly high. Or for something that&rsquo;s extremely hard to do at all, and is likely to just have bad consequences (such as trying to wound a dragon) both the Close and Clear numbers may be rather high.</p>

<h4>Critical Success</h4>

<p>The higher the Player rolls, the better the results the DM will narrate, and if they roll a &lsquo;natural 20&rsquo; it always counts as a &lsquo;Close&rsquo; result even if the actual Close number is much higher as long as whatever they were attempting is actually possible for them to do at all. </p>

<p>On a natural 20 a Character also does double the Effect with their action, and the Player gets to either State A Fact from the Fact list which will add some additional beneficial effect to whatever risk was just avoided or gain back 1D3 Fortune points, their choice. </p>

<h4>Critical Failure</h4>

<p>Conversely, the lower the player rolls, the harsher the consequences will be from the DM, with a Natural 1 always having some consequences, even if when the Player adds the Attributes, Talents, and Fortune from their Character to the roll it puts the total number into the Clear.</p>

<h3>Common Difficulties</h3>

<p>Here&rsquo;s a list of common ranges for Close and Clear to choose from, but it&rsquo;s always up to the DM to decide the final numbers a Roll needs to meet.</p>

<h4>Close</h4>

<ul>
    <li>Trivial Close Difficulty: 2</li>

    <li>Minor Close Difficulty: 6</li>

    <li>Simple Close Difficulty: 10</li>

    <li>Serious Close Difficulty: 14</li>

    <li>Heroic Close Difficulty: 18</li>

</ul>
<h4>Clear</h4>

<ul>
    <li>Trivial Clear Difficulty: 6</li>

    <li>Minor Clear Difficulty: 10</li>

    <li>Simple Clear Difficulty: 14</li>

    <li>Serious Clear Difficulty: 18</li>

    <li>Heroic Clear Difficulty: 22</li>

</ul>
<p>Trivial: 2 for Close, 6 for Clear</p>

<p>Minor: 6 for Close, 10 for Clear</p>

<p>Simple: 10 for Close, 14 for Clear</p>

<p>Serious: 14 for Close, 18 for Clear</p>

<p>Heroic: 18 for Close, 22 for Clear</p>

<p>So as an example a &lsquo;standard&rsquo; simple difficulty for most things that are risky-but-totally-possible &nbsp;would be &ldquo;10 for Close, 14 for Clear&rdquo;. This would be for things like fighting off untrained bandits, climbing a tricky wall, sneaking past normal guards, etc. </p>

<p>A &lsquo;hard&rsquo; serious difficulty would be &ldquo;14 for Close, 18 for Clear&rdquo; for things that are risky under even good circumstances. Things like fighting off highly trained warriors, climbing a crumbling wall as it&rsquo;s falling apart into lava below, or sneaking past alerted centuries during wartime, etc.</p>

<p>Another example would be something that&rsquo;s easy to do, but hard to do without consequences. Like pick-pocketing a City Guard in broad daylight. This could be something like &ldquo;6 for close, 18 for clear&rdquo;, for it&rsquo;s easy to steal from the guard, but very hard to do so without them noticing something.</p>

<h4>Positioning</h4>

<p>The GM will consider the narrative, and anything clever (or dumb) the Players may have done so far, to help pick or modify these difficulty numbers. What would normally be a &lsquo;Serious&rsquo; difficulty could be made Minor by the clever actions of the Party; conversely something that should be easy could be made very hard by someone doing something fantastically stupid.</p>

<p>For example, if one of the Players had turned themselves invisible, and then snuck up undetected to be able to point-blank shoot the dangerous evil boss, what would normally be a Serious thing to do (hit this powerful boss with an arrow and get away with no consequences) could be turned into a Trivial thing instead.</p>

<p>Or, if the Party has been foolish, and brazenly stolen something from the local temple, then social rolls in town that would have been Minor could all now be Serious or worse.</p>

<p>So the GM will set the Close and Clear numbers based on both what the Players are trying to do right now and what they have done so far in the story so far.</p>

<h4>Consequences</h4>

<p>When consequences are required due to a Close or Missed Roll, the DM will pick (or roll randomly for) from the following list, or tell the player to do so instead:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Reduce the Effect of something that just happened</li>

    <li>Introduce a Complication / Reveal an Unwelcome Truth</li>

    <li>Lost Opportunity, Try Something Else</li>

    <li>Put Someone in a Spot</li>

    <li>Use up a Resource / Take Away Something Important</li>

    <li>Move a Clock forward (or back!)</li>

    <li>Show the Downside of something / Embarrass Someone</li>

    <li>Cause Harm</li>

</ol>

<p>On a Close, the action is still always&nbsp;successful, it&rsquo;s just that some additional consequences have also happened. Those consequences should not be severe, either, and should hopefully add to the Story in a fun way.</p>

<p>On a Miss, it&rsquo;s up to the DM whether the action happens or not, and there are always additional consequences. Those consequences should be meaningful to the Story, actually consequential, and more severe the lower the result of the Roll was, with a Hard Miss being something that&rsquo;s really going to &ldquo;sting&rdquo;.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s critically important to understand that a Miss is not a < ="c10">Failure, it&rsquo;s more that something bad has happened. No Roll ever results in &lsquo;Nothing Happens&rsquo;.</p>

<h5>Reduce the Effect of something that just happened</h5>

<p>Instead of an action moving a Clock a normal amount for that action, it moves it less, or possibly not at all for a Hard Miss. Or if there is no Clock, while an action was successful it&rsquo;s just less so, such as not getting as good of a deal when haggling as they had wished for, or only being able to find enough food to not go hungry for now, but not enough to travel very far.</p>

<h5>Introduce a Complication / Reveal an Unwelcome Truth</h5>

<p>Whether the action was successful or not, it has revealed an Unwelcome Truth; such as successfully sneaking past the guards just to have them close and lock the door behind the Party as the guard changes. Or on a Hard Miss it&rsquo;s revealed that the monsters are completely immune to fire after the Party tried to thwart it&rsquo;s advance with a large bonfire. Some new fact is introduced that makes everything harder for our players in some direct way.</p>
<h5>Lost Opportunity, Try Something Else</h5>
<p>Whether the action was successful or not, the opportunity has passed, and the Party won&rsquo;t be able to do it again (and on a Hard Miss, if at all!). Maybe the thief got the lock open, but has run out of time to look in the chest before the guards come. Maybe they will need a distraction? Or on a Hard Miss they broke the lock, and there is no way anyone could pick it now. Maybe they try smashing the chest open instead? Whatever it is, the opportunity they were aiming for with the Action has passed, and they will need to try something different next time.</p>
<h5>Put Someone in a Spot</h5>
<p>Whether the action was successful or not, someone in the Party is now in immediate trouble of some kind. Such as a warrior successfully fought off the monsters that were attacking them to find they are now separated from the rest of the group and standing on the edge of a crumbling cliff that&rsquo;s about to give way. Or on a Hard Miss, while the warrior is fine, the wizard is not, and has been grabbed by the monsters who are starting to carry them off. It&rsquo;s important to note that any consequence from a close or missed roll can happen to anyone in the story, it doesn&rsquo;t have to happen to the player who made the roll.</p>
<h5>Use up a Resource / Take Away Something Important</h5>
<p>This one is very straightforward, simply have something important break, or get stolen, or get removed from the party in some way. </p>
<h5>Move a Clock forward (or back!)</h5>
<p>If there is a Clock for some even that they Players are hoping won&rsquo;t happen, such as being discovered, move that Clock forward! Or if there is a Clock the Players were hoping to fill, such as defeating an enemy, move that Clock backwards as that enemy heals itself or moves into a better position, etc.</p>
<h5>Show the Downside of something / Embarrass Someone</h5>
<p>Sometimes a miss will just make someone look bad. So the thief picks the lock just to have the door fly open on them, causing them to fall face-first into the room beyond. The wizard discovers when trying to read the ancient and inscrutable tomb that they were holding it upside down. The brave warrior turns out to be absolutely terrible at telling jokes at the royal ball. Do something that shows a Character to not be the perfect hero!</p>
<h5>Cause Harm</h5>
<p>The most basic and direct consequence of them all, simply cause a Harm to befall someone in the story. So on a Hard Miss, the warrior not only fails to hurt the monster in a fight, but gets a Serious Harm as the monster bites deeply into his arm, rendering it useless until healed. Or on a Close, you managed to talk your way into the party, but accidentally insulted the host, and take a minor Spiritual Harm of being that jerk at the party that no one invited.</p>
<h3>DM Rolls</h3>
<p>Sometimes the DM might roll to see what happens in a situation. In this case the DM will call the Close and Clear numbers, make a Roll adding whatever appropriate bonuses, and If the DM rolls for something important and misses, the Players get to pick from a list of consequences that the DM will then add to the Story.</p>
<h3>Lucky vs. Unlucky</h3>
<p>There are times where a Roll is Lucky or Unlucky. A Lucky roll is one where the Player will roll two D20&rsquo;s, and take the higher result, and an Unlucky roll is one where the Player will roll two D20&rsquo;s, and take the lower result. Rolls can be made Lucky or Unlucky by a Player spending Fortune, a Character&#39;s special Talent, or deemed so by the DM depending upon what&rsquo;s happening in the Story.</p>
<h3>Aid</h3>
<p>When the GM askes a Player to make a Roll, another Player can choose to give Aid. This forfeits the next action from the Player giving the Aid (as they are busy helping) but then lets the Player giving the aid choose one of the following advantages to give to the Player receiving Aid:</p>
<ul><li>They are Lucky for this Roll.</li>
<li>They will do one level higher of Effect if they get a Close or a Clear on this Roll.</li>
<li>They will receive one level lower of Harm, or a lesser Consequence, if they get a Miss on this Roll.</li>
</ul><p>The Player giving Aid describes how they are doing so, which could trigger a Roll for the Player giving the Aid if the GM thinks it&rsquo;s risky.</p>
<p>Or if they would like to, the Player giving the Aid can spend one Fortune Point to not lose their next action and to not have to Roll to Aid another Player, even if how they described they were providing that Aid could expose them to risk.</p>
<h2>Clocks &amp; Effect</h2>
<p>In Heroic Blades, any challenge faced by the characters that can&rsquo;t be overcome with a single Roll are represented by Clocks. Sections of the Clock are filled in as the Players make Rolls that result in a positive Effect on that challenge, and sections are removed when something happens that has a negative Effect on them overcoming that Challenge.</p>
<p>A Minor Effect will fill one tick of a Clock, a Standard Effect fills in two ticks of a Clock, a Greater Effect fills in three ticks, and a Heroic Effect will fill in four ticks of a Clock.</p>
<p>When fighting enemies, they too are represented by Clocks, and in this case Effect is equivalent to &lsquo;Damage&rsquo;, and when the Clock is filled the enemy is defeated.</p>
<p>Clocks can also represent approaching dangers, such as being detected while sneaking about, or running out of time to escape a collapsing temple; in these cases the Clock is typically reversed, with the GM filling in the Clock as time passes or as a consequence of the Players missing a Roll, and the Players able to remove ticks by doing clever things and/or making Clear Rolls. &nbsp;</p>
<h4>Positioning</h4>
<p>Positioning can add or subtract from Effect. If the Players and the DM all agree that a Player has done something clever to put their Character into a superior position for a specific action, The Effect of that action is doubled, Roll required or not, and if required it&rsquo;s also possible that the roll moves down one rank or more in difficulty as well.</p>
<p>Likewise, if the Players and the DM all agree that a Character has been placed into a really bad situation, their Effect is Halved (Roll required or not).</p>
<h4>Range</h4>
<p>Some items and spells have a Range associated with them. If the item is being used on a target that is one step away from its listed range, then it does one less Effect; if it&rsquo;s more than one step away it does no Effect.</p>
<p>Ranges are:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Touch - within easy reach without having to take a step.</li>
<li>Close - within reach of a one-handed weapon, a good kick, or by taking one or two steps.</li>
<li>Reach - within reach of a two-handed long weapon such as a spear, a great leap, or by taking multiple steps.</li>
<li>Mid - within reach of a simple bow, a thrown rock, or a good shout.</li>
<li>Far - &nbsp;within reach of a fine bow, or a good horse at a run.</li>
<li>Very Far - just within sight</li>
</ul>
<h3>Player vs. DM / Enemies / Combat</h3>
<p>When the Players engage in a fight vs. enemies that are controlled by the DM, The DM will make Clocks for each group of Enemies that once cleared, the threat has passed. The DM can choose to show these Clocks to the players or keep them secret. The DM will then call upon the different Players to take turns, with the order based off of what&rsquo;s happening in the story determining who goes when. </p>
<p>Then once all the Players have had a turn, each &lsquo;Clocks; worth of Enemies gets to take a turn.</p>
<h3 ="c21" id="h.lz42y7om31ba">Player vs. Player</h3>
<p>When two Players decide to go head-to-head about something, first stop the game altogether, let the Players cool off for a moment, and then the DM will ask the Players what their Character&rsquo;s single goal they are trying to achieve with this conflict, and how far are they willing to go to achieve it, which the Players both openly state before a Roll is made. The DM then says back what sensible outcomes would happen upon a Successful roll for each player, and asks both Players if they agree to those outcomes. If both players can&#39;t agree on the outcomes the DM has put forth that a Roll would result in, the defender decides the outcome instead without a Roll being made at all.</p>
<p>Both Players then announce what Attribute, Talents, and Fortune they are going to use that best fits what their Characters are trying to do, and both Players make a Roll. Whomever rolls higher succeeds and has no consequences, and the other gets the Consequences the DM states.</p>
<h2 ="c19" id="h.a7gcmytxzo3h">< ="c14">Fortune</h2>
<p>Fortune is a resource Characters have that Players can spend to effect Rolls, make Saves, and to activate specific Talents. A Character starts the game with Nine Fortune points to spend per Quest, can gain more through special Talents, and can refresh them during Downtime between Encounters by telling stories from their history and people. They fully refresh at the start of every Quest.</p>
<p>A Player can:</p>
<ul ="c3 lst-kix_vuwag9lnqbqd-0 start"><li>Spend one Fortune point to Aid another Player, and make their roll Lucky before it&rsquo;s rolled.</li>
<li>Spend two Fortune points to Spout Lore, and make their own roll Lucky before it&rsquo;s rolled.</li>
<li>Spend three Fortune points to re-roll a roll after it was rolled.</li>
<li>Spend four Fortune points to make someone else re-roll a roll after it was rolled (including the DM).</li>
<li>< ="c11">Spend any number of Fortune points before a Roll to increase Effect, one per rank of Effect.</li>
<li>< ="c11">Spend any number of Fortune points before or after the Roll to add +1 per Fortune spent.</li>
<li><>Spend one Fortune (or more) to make a Save to avoid Harm.</li>
<li>< ="c11">Spend a Fortune point to enable their Character with Serious Harm to make a Roll at all.</li>
<li>< ="c11">Spend a Fortune point to enable another player&rsquo;s Character with Heroic Harm to make a Roll at all.</li>
<li>< ="c11">Spend a specific number of Fortune points to activate a specific Talent that they have.</li>
</ul><p ="c4">< ="c11"></p>
<p>< ="c11">When a Character runs out of Fortune, they are out of the current Encounter, and they gain a Scar. Write down on the Character sheet what Scar they received that&rsquo;s relevant to the story based off of what just happened. They then rejoin in Downtime after the current Encounter is over with all their Fortune points restored.</p>
<p ="c4">< ="c11"></p>
<p>< ="c11">Once a Character gains four Scars, they are Defeated. See the Defeated &amp; Death section.</p>
<h4 ="c22" id="h.8uf2e01cui4p">Spout Lore</h4>
<p><>A Player can spend two Fortune points to Spout Lore, whereby some ancient lore or teachings the Character knows is able to directly help whatever challenge they are currently facing. The Player is then Lucky for their next Roll.</p>
<h4 ="c22" id="h.kxp9cdyposkb">Telling Stories</h4>
<p>As a Rest action, a player can choose to Tell A Story, which restores Fortune points. This story can be from the Character&rsquo;s past, their people, a legend from the world, an old fable or song, really anything that&rsquo;s relevant to them, true or not. The DM will pick details from these stories that will become &lsquo;canon&rsquo; in the story and the setting, as well as possible future challenges the Characters may encounter.</p>
<p>Telling a Story automatically restores two Fortune Points, and if everyone agrees that it was a really awesome story the DM can reward extra points. The DM can also threaten to give less Fortune points if the story is going on way too long.</p>
<h4 ="c22" id="h.4fuzi38jknwe">Preparation</h4>
<p><>Fortune can be &lsquo;earned&rsquo; and &lsquo;saved&rsquo; for a specific Roll via Preparation, with every act of Preparation done equal to one extra Fortune point that can only be applied to a Roll that regards the event that was Prepared for.</p>
<h2 ="c19" id="h.xmfmvz9kk7hq">< ="c14">Harm</h2>
<p>Bad things happen to adventures in our story. Harm is how we keep track of it. There are three kinds of Harm: </p>
<p>< ="c8">Physical Harm, which affects the physical abilities of a Character, and is Resisted using the Prowess Group Total. These are things like wounds, injuries, broken bones, and other physical Harm. </p>
<p>< ="c8">Mental Harm, which affects the mental abilities of a Character, and is Resisted using the Insight Group Total. These are things like getting stunned, hypnotized, psychic or certain magical spells, and other Harm.</p>
<p>< ="c8">Spiritual Harm, which affects the spiritual abilities of a Character, and is Resisted using the Spirit Group Total. These are things like being insulted, exhausted, cursed, corrupted by Dark Forces, or excommunicated.</p>
<p>< ="c11">The DM will proclaim what sort of Harm happened, and whether it&rsquo;s Minor, Serious, Heroic, or Lethal.</p>
<p ="c4">< ="c11"></p>
<p>< ="c11">Minor Harm is something that causes a nuisance, but doesn&rsquo;t stop a Character from being able to do things that take Rolls using the Attributes within the relevant group, it&rsquo;s just going to make them slightly less Effective at it. Minor Harm can also be negated completely when a Character Takes A Rest, and uses the Recover action.</p>
<p ="c4">< ="c11"></p>
<p>< ="c11">Serious Harm is something that hinders a Character in a serious way, and while they can still do things that take Rolls using the Attributes within the relevant group, it&rsquo;s harder for them to do so as it makes them Unlucky. Serious Harm also takes longer to Recover from, in that a Recover action when Resting or from most spells will only reduce it to a Minor Harm instead of removing it completely.</p>
<p ="c4">< ="c11"></p>
<p>< ="c11">Heroic Harm is something that limits a Character from being able to make any Roll using the relevant Attributes without having to spend a Fortune to do so, or without getting Aid from another. It&rsquo;s also very hard to recover from, in that a Recover action only reduces it to a Serious Harm.</p>
<p ="c4">< ="c11"></p>
<p>< ="c11">Lethal Harm is something that removes a Character from the current Quest by rendering them Defeated, and is only resolved via the &ldquo;Defeated &amp; Death&rdquo; rules.</p>
<p ="c4">< ="c11"></p>
<p>< ="c11">An important thing to note is that Harm of one type only affects Rolls made using attributes from that Type; so for example a Character with a Heroic Physical Harm could still use their Mental or Spiritual attributes at full strength, a Character with Serious Spiritual and Mental Harm can still use their Physical Attributes full strength, etc. </p>
<h3 ="c21" id="h.j4r200531t69">Examples of Harm</h3>
<h4 ="c22" id="h.db30fzjg5epv">Physical Harm Examples</h4>
<ul ="c3 lst-kix_ilyu7ol35gn7-0 start"><li>< ="c11">Minor Physical Harm would be cuts and scrapes, bruises from getting hit, a small burn, etc.</li>
<li>< ="c11">Serious Physical Harm would be a stab wound, a fractured bone, a serious burn, etc.</li>
<li>< ="c11">Heroic Physical Harm would be a deep cut, a compound fracture, being engulfed in flame, etc.</li>
<li>< ="c11">Lethal Physical Harm would be getting cut in half, being crushed under falling rocks, being engulfed in lava, etc.</li>
</ul><h4 ="c22" id="h.utukaqowhs8z">Metal Harm Examples</h4>
<ul ="c3 lst-kix_iugyy1gx3trc-0 start"><li>Minor Mental Harm would be a bad headache, confusion, being rather drunk, etc.</li>
<li>Serious Mental Harm would be a heavy migraine, delusional, being drugged, etc.</li>
<li>Heroic Mental Harm would be a psychic blast, hallucinating, being anesthetized, etc. </li>
<li>Lethal Mental Harm would be a psychic vortex, complete ego dissociation, being made comatose, etc.</li>
</ul><h4 ="c22" id="h.d9gm9d1qa4e">Spiritual Harm Examples</h4>
<ul ="c3 lst-kix_p2dycur8vf37-0 start"><li>Minor Mental Harm would be a bad insult, a small rumor, a spiritual warning, etc.</li>
<li>Serious Spiritual Harm would be a major insult, a vicious rumor, a minor curse, etc.</li>
<li>Heroic Spiritual Harm would be a royal insult, an expose, a major curse, etc.</li>
<li>Lethal Spiritual Harm would be a life-changing moment of clarity, an excommunication, your soul being permanently tainted, etc.</li>
</ul><h3 ="c21" id="h.8bioiob7dyhd">Results of Harm</h3>
<p>When your Character has a Minor Harm, they do one level lower of Effect for any action that uses Attributes from the relevant group based on that type of Harm. A Character can have two Minor Harms at one time, and if they are the same type, they now do two levels of Effect for any action that uses those Attributes. Minor Harm does &lsquo;stack&rsquo; such that if your Character already has two Minor Harms, and takes a third, it automatically becomes a Serious Harm instead.</p>
<p>When your Character has a Serious Harm, they are now Unlucky on any Rolls using an Attribute from the relevant group based on the type of Harm. A Character can have two Serious Harms at one time, and if they are of the same Type, they now are Doubly Unlucky, and have to roll four dice and take the lowest result when using those Attributes. These also &lsquo;stack&rsquo; like Minor Harm, in that if a Character already has two Serious Harms, and takes a third, it automatically becomes a Heroic Harm instead.</p>
<p>< ="c11">When your Character has Heroic Harm, they have to either spend a Fortune point, or get Aid from another player&rsquo;s Character, to make any Roll using an Attribute from the relevant group. A Character can only have one Heroic Harm, and if they take another, it automatically becomes a Lethal Harm. &nbsp;</p>
<p ="c4">< ="c11"></p>
<p>< ="c11">Lethal Harm means the Character is now Defeated. See the Defeated &amp; Death section.</p>
<p ="c4">< ="c11"></p>
<p>< ="c11">For most Stories of a normal level of intensity most Harm resulting from GM-chosen consequences should be Serious Harm. The Characters have lots of Fortune and Talents to reduce harm, so don&rsquo;t shy away from dealing it out to push them to use Fortune, tell stories to regain Fortune, and finishing Quests to recover completely. </p>
<h3 ="c21" id="h.eg870n1h8lpo"><>Making a Save</h3>
<p>< ="c11">When a Character suffers Harm, the Player can choose to make a Save. A Save is almost just like another Roll, as the DM calls out a Close and a Clear value to do so, but it&rsquo;s different in what Attribute you use, as it&rsquo;s up to the DM as to which Attribute Group Total the players will use for the roll.</p>
<p ="c4">< ="c11"></p>
<p>< ="c11">So the Player then takes the relevant Attribute Group Total the DM selected, adds any relevant Armor they may have (and whatever Fortune they may want to spend to add to the roll), and then rolls a D20 adding all these bonuses to try to make the Save.</p>
<p ="c4">< ="c11"></p>
<p>< ="c11">On a Clear, the Character spends one Fortune point and somehow miraculously takes no Harm.</p>
<p ="c4">< ="c11"></p>
<p>< ="c11">On a Close, the Player rolls a D4, subtracts that many Fortune points, and miraculously takes no Harm.</p>
<p ="c4">< ="c11"></p>
<p>< ="c11">And on a Miss they roll a D4, subtract that many Fortune points, and take a lesser but similar Harm one level lower than the original Harm.</p>
<p ="c4">< ="c11"></p>
<p>< ="c11">If the Player rolls a Critical Success, it counts as a Clear no matter the actual number set by the GM, they get all the Fortune Points they spent on this Roll back (if any), and they gain an additional 1D4 Fortune points (but do not get to pick a fact from the State A Fact list).</p>
<p ="c4">< ="c11"></p>
<p>< ="c11">If the Player rolls a Critical Failure, they don&rsquo;t spend any Fortune, but they take the original Harm.</p>
<p ="c4">< ="c11"></p>
<p>< ="c11">It&rsquo;s important to note that making a Save only applies to Harm that has befallen a Character, and not other consequences that came from their actions or a Missed Roll, and a Save has to be made immediately at the moment the Harm befalls the Character, and can&rsquo;t be made later.</p>
<h2 ="c19" id="h.ytyp1ie8xm1e">< ="c14">Defeated &amp; Death</h2>
<p>When a Character gains four Scars or a Lethal level of Harm, they are Defeated.</p>
<p>The Player can choose if they want to Revive, Retire, or go out in a Blaze of Glory.</p>
<h4 ="c22" id="h.y6iubg2l4t1k">Revive</h4>
<p>If they choose to Revive, the Character is immediately unable to act for the current Encounter and the remainder of the current Quest and subsequent Downtime. They are out of the game. The Player can have this Character return for a future Quest, but they have to have changed the Character in some fundamental way (work with the DM on this) and the Player and the rest of the Party has to meet the DM&rsquo;s requirements as well (if there are any).</p>
<h4 ="c22" id="h.cxzaxylxm5s7">Retire</h4>
<p>If they choose to Retire, the Character is able to complete the current Encounter, but not the current Quest, and instead is out of the game. The Character can stay in the Story, but as background character, and is unable to directly aid in Encounters or Quests, but can aid the Party during Free Play.</p>
<h4 ="c22" id="h.tgz0w4b5yn0w">Blaze of Glory</h4>
<p>If they choose to go out in a Blaze of Glory, the Character gets to pick its Final Act from the list, perform that Act, and then they are Dead, and removed from the game.</p>
<h5id="h.el616ar8ikum">Final Acts</h5>
<ol ="c3 lst-kix_h1p7hvo5iupd-0 start" start="1"><li>&lt;list final acts here&gt;</li>
</ol>
<h2 ="c19" id="h.b7xggbxhsa45">< ="c14">Example of Play</h2>
<h2 ="c19" id="h.hmcuzgx04nq"><>The Attributes </h2>
<p>Attributes represent how good the character is at certain important Actions, such as Fighting monsters, Sneaking past guards, Studying magical scrolls, Noticing that the king is lying to them, or Corusing with local merchants to learn important facts.</p>
<p>They are grouped into three categories, Physical, Mental, and Spiritual. They can vary from -3 (very bad) to +3 (very good!), which are the amounts you add or subtract to your Roll when doing something risky using that Attribute.</p>
<p>Each Attribute Group has an advancement track. As the Players complete Quests, or spend their Resting time in Training, they will get points to spend on advancement. When an advancement track is filled, it&rsquo;s reset to zero, and the player can add a +1 to an attribute within that group.</p>
<p>Attribute Groups are also used when making a Save. When a player decides to gamble Fortune and try to make a Save to lessen the Harm from an immediate consequence, they get a +1 to add to the Save roll for every Attribute in that group that is a +1 or higher (up to a maximum of +4, if all Attributes within that group are at a +1 or higher). Attributes that are zero, or negative, don&rsquo;t impact the Save roll or subtract from it, they simply don&rsquo;t help with any sort of bonus.. &nbsp;</p>
<h3 ="c21" id="h.em583nagah43">Physical</h3>
<p>Physical stats represent the raw physical abilities of your character. </p>
<h4 ="c22" id="h.3pz8j49v3ic4">Fight</h4>
<p>Whether by sword or by bow, by strength or by speed, upfront or from afar, when it comes to fighting this is the stat that determines what you roll. </p>
<h4 ="c22" id="h.b2f1w8n1bz10">Finesse</h4>
<p>When performing feats of physical daring, such as dodging the falling spikes, dancing gracefully at the ball, carefully picking a lock or pocket, or impressing with acrobatic moves this is the stat that determines what you roll.</p>
<h4 ="c22" id="h.5vtkspijgcl2">Wreck</h4>
<p>Whether by brute force or perfect application of force, whenever you are destroying something, breaking open a door, smashing into a group of enemies with your shield, prying open a chest, or bringing down a castle wall, this is the stat that determines what you roll.</p>
<h4 ="c22" id="h.shst9kq0h9op">Sneak</h4>
<p>Either by being quick, quiet, and/or clever, whenever you don&rsquo;t want to be seen and/or heard, this is the stat that determines what you roll.</p>
<h3 ="c21" id="h.yj669uid1ojp">Mental</h3>
<p>Mental stats represent the raw mental abilities of your character.</p>
<h4 ="c22" id="h.wby0v3vam7g7">Notice</h4>
<p>When it comes to noticing things, detecting a lie, or reading a situation; for everything concerning immediate awareness this is the stat that determines what you roll.</p>
<h4 ="c22" id="h.blymmpvb5b6z">Study</h4>
<p>Hitting the books, watching from afar in a stake-out, piecing together clues from random people; anything concerning awareness over time, this is the stat that determines what you roll.</p>
<h4 ="c22" id="h.7rtrcw8t0axs">Craft</h4>
<p>Whenever you&rsquo;re making something, assessing the quality of something, brewing, cooking, mending, or putting together makeshift things in a hurry, this is the stat that determines what you roll.</p>
<h4 ="c22" id="h.s74vwm1yifk3">Lore</h4>
<p>When you&#39;re remembering the stories of your people, your studies of archaic lore, spouting history, sharing deep mysteries won thru prior study, or anything else you might know this is the stat that determines what you roll. </p>
<h3 ="c21" id="h.wit2eaqm6z9o">Spiritual</h3>
<p>Spiritual stats represent the raw spiritual and social abilities of your character.</p>
<h4 ="c22" id="h.bap3ri8ylli1">Attune</h4>
<p>When you&rsquo;re connecting to the magic within an item, or the spirits of a place, the most wise way forward, or seeking an empathic connection to another, this is the stat that determines your roll. </p>
<h4 ="c22" id="h.dri8u0xe8pg">Endure</h4>
<p>When you&rsquo;re facing terrible hardships with true grit alone, struggling to survive through raw endurance, &ldquo;toughing it out&rdquo;, or going head to head in a magical struggle of willpower, this is the stat that determines your roll.</p>
<h4 ="c22" id="h.oh51gfrwoo23">Convince</h4>
<p>When you&rsquo;re pleading your case, bravely leading an army, trying to manipulate a shopkeeper, intimidating a guard, or telling a bold-faced lie, this is the stat that determines your roll.</p>
<h4 ="c22" id="h.8usyrwi9o5hd">Carouse</h4>
<p>Making the rounds for information, trying to impress at a party, being a clown, or vying for a clever position within Court, this is the stat that determines your roll.</p>
<h2 ="c19" id="h.enai8nqoxaad">< ="c14">Creation Summary</h2>
<p>Each character starts the game with five Special Abilities:</p>
<ul ="c3 lst-kix_so3qxzscc5ie-0 start"><li><>Two from their < ="c29 c8">Background</li>
<li><>Two from <>their < ="c8">Trade (<>or < ="c8">Trades)</li>
<li><>One from their < ="c8 c29">Heroic Blade</li>
</ul><p>No &lsquo;playbooks&rsquo;, &lsquo;races&rsquo;, or &lsquo;es&rsquo; in Heroic Blades. </p>
<p>Instead you pick Two Backgrounds that when combined best represent the advantages gained by your character&rsquo;s heritage and history, i.e. where they came from. Each of these will give you a Feat and a minor Flaw to go with it.</p>
<p>Then you pick a Trade that best represents what they currently can do in terms of skill. This Trade will come with a Starting Feat, which is the first one you take when you pick that Trade.</p>
<p>Then you either pick another Special Ability from your Trade&rsquo;s list that best represents the specialization your character has within that Trade; or if you want to generalize you can pick a different Trade, and take it&rsquo;s Starting Special Ability instead.</p>
<p>Then, you pick a Special Ability the magic of your Heroic Blade gives you. Again, it doesn&rsquo;t literally have to be a &lsquo;blade&rsquo;, it can be any item you&rsquo;d like it to be that best fits your idea for your character. </p>
<p>Last, you assign five Ranks to your Attributes.</p>
<p>A few examples.</p>
<p><>A Dwarven Warrior of a Lost Clan could pick the &lsquo;Underground&rsquo; and &lsquo;No Home To Return To&rsquo; backgrounds, the &lsquo;Warrior&rsquo; and &lsquo;Smith&rsquo; Trades, and for an Heroic Blade a Battle <>Axe&nbsp;that causes extra damage to the sworn enemy of the Dwarfs, the goblins.</p>
<p>An Elvin Archer from the Forest could pick the &lsquo;Nature&rsquo; and &lsquo;Raised By Wolves&rsquo; backgrounds, the &lsquo;Master Warrior&rsquo; Trade along with another Special Move from that Trade to be an expert of the longbow, and for an Heroic Blade a magical bow that&rsquo;s &lsquo;lucky&rsquo; and lets them re-roll any one roll once per session. </p>
<p>As you advance you get to pick new Special Abilities from your Trade, for your Blade, or a starting Move from a new Trade altogether. It&rsquo;s best if there is something that happened in the story that aligns with the new Special Ability. And you never gain new Background Special Abilities, you only get those when you first create a character.</p>
<h2 ="c19" id="h.y4rnpvwjjx0k">< ="c14">Backgrounds</h2>
<p><>Your Backgrounds gives your character Special Abilities or advantages, a possible future hindrance that comes with it, and the root of the stories you tell from your people and past.</p>
<p><>Pick Two when you first create your character, or if you want to randomize it, roll a D20 twice to determine them.</p>

<p><>Your Character&rsquo;s Trade is what skills they have mastered well enough to ply a trade in. When you first create your character, pick a Trade, and take its Starting Talent, which is the first one shown in < ="c8">Bold. Then, either pick another Talent from that Trade, or pick a different Trade altogether, and take its Starting Talent instead.</p>
<p>Or if you&rsquo;d rather randomize it, roll a D10 for the category, then a D4 for the specific Trade within, to determine each starting Trade; and roll a D6 to determine another Talent within that Trade.</p>
<p>As you play, your Character will gain Experience, which you can then use to Level Up. When you Level Up, your Character gains new Talents from the Trades your Character has. Or, if the Story so far supports it, you can choose a new Trade when you Level Up instead, and gain its starting Talent instead.</p>
<p>A character can only have up to three Trades at any given time. At any time you can choose to retire a Trade, but in doing so the Character loses whatever Talents gained from it. </p>

<p>The Party will have a Party Quest, an overall goal that it&rsquo;s trying to achieve. Again, pick from the list below, or randomly roll to select it.</p>
<ol ="c3 lst-kix_5ngo7f5ziws5-0 start" start="1"><li>The Party wants to get rich or die trying.</li>
<li>The Party wants to obtain, rescue, or recover a single great treasure (or person).</li>

</ol>
<h2 ="c19" id="h.hdb4lo6u92gy">< ="c14">Reputation</h2>
<p>The Party earns Reputation by accomplishing various Quests. As it does, it earns Experience, which advances the Party Advancement Track. When this track is filled, </p>
<h1 ="c15" id="h.efyxtskqyukk">< ="c18">The Forces</h1><p>Forces are the various factions, political powers, major themes, and/or gods of our Story. They can be anything as literal as a specific evil king to more general elements like an adventurer&rsquo;s guild to as conceptual as things like &lsquo;poverty&rsquo; or &lsquo;hunger&rsquo;. </p>
<p>Forces get a name, a few written details about them, and a Magnitude from minor to heroic that represents how big of an impact they have in the world.</p>
<p>Hopefully during character generation a few Forces have already been made, and it&rsquo;s great to add a few more so that there are at least three to five Forces total in the Story. </p>
<p>If you want a Story full of intrigue, gray areas, and politics add more Forces, and add some details about what the various Forces are for and against (and which ones hate the other ones). If you want a Story with less of that and more of a &lsquo;good vs. evil&rsquo; arc stick with fewer, larger Forces. </p>
<p>As you play the game, the DM will introduce new Forces, and remove current Forces, depending upon where the Story goes. For example, the Characters may travel to flee a Force, when if successful, </p>
<h1 ="c15" id="h.zewoyih35sef">< ="c18">The World</h1><p>It&rsquo;s fun to ask the Players what additional elements or details are part of the world our Story is going to take place in. Each player should add two to three details that they either make up, pick from this list below, or randomly roll for on the list below.</p>
<p>&lt;World Detail List Goes Here&gt;</p>
<h1 ="c15" id="h.3slwd0snmt3c">< ="c18">Quests</h1><p>Quests can be picked from this list, rolled randomly from this list, or just made up.</p>
<ol ="c3 lst-kix_trd34mi7tdiy-0 start" start="1"><li>Loot something important</li>
<li>Save a something or someone</li>
<li>Kill a monster or monsters</li>

<li>Break a curse or end some magical effect</li>
<li>Travel somewhere through a dangerous area</li>
<li>Escape from a bad situation</li>
</ol>
<p>A Trivial Quest is just a single Encounter, a Standard Quest is 2-3 Encounter, a Serious Quest is 3-5 Encounter, and a Heroic Quest is 5 or more Encounter.</p>
<p>Every time a Quest is completed the Party earns Reputation, which lets the Party and the Characters Level Up.</p>
<h1 ="c15" id="h.17v729ox4v8n">< ="c18">The Campaign Clock</h1><p>There&rsquo;s a &lsquo;master clock&rsquo; for the whole campaign, kept in secret by the GM, that as sections are filled unleash the &lsquo;approaching doom&rsquo; of our story.</p>
<p>At the start, with no ticks filled, the Players pick from the available Quests.</p>
<p>When the Campaign Clock strikes three, there is a reveal of a Grim Portent, that some larger force is behind whatever troubles the Players have been struggling with all this time.</p>
<p>When the Campaign Clock strikes six, Things Start Getting Real, the larger force is revealed, and if the players don&rsquo;t stop it, something they care about in their world will end.</p>
<p>When the Campaign Clock strikes nine, some longshot hope is revealed on how they can stop the larger force, maybe requiring some side quests to obtain items or help.</p>
<p>When the Campaign Clock strikes Midnight, it&rsquo;s time for the Big Showdown, ready or not.</p>
<p>This clock is advanced by a single tick when:</p>
<ul ="c3 lst-kix_whia3cjm3ozy-0 start"><li>A 6 is made on an entanglement roll.</li>
<li>A 1-3 is rolled on an Action Roll, if the GM thinks it&rsquo;s a good consequence to have from the Action being taken.</li>
<li>The GM decides it&rsquo;s time to move the Campaign Clock forward a tick because of something happening (or not happening fast enough!) in the story.</li>
</ul><h1 ="c15" id="h.vfo449c8yn7d">< ="c18">Magic</h1><p>Magic is powerful. Thus spells are risky for those Characters untrained in a Sphere of Magic, and so will require a Roll to be made to avoid any consequences. Characters properly trained in a particular Sphere of Magic can cast spells within that Sphere without that risk, and as long as the Character isn&rsquo;t hampered in some way, the spell happens without needing a Roll (however other circumstances happening to the Character while they are casting a spell might require a Roll, such as to avoid getting hit by an attack while trying to cast their spell&hellip;). </p>
<p>There are Cantrip, Simple, Serious, and Heroic levels of magic, and they cost Fortune to cast.</p>
<ul ="c3 lst-kix_ythczsbhb5wm-0 start"><li>Cantrips do one level of effect and cost two Fortune to cast.</li>
<li>Simple spells do two levels of effect and cost three Fortune to cast.</li>
<li>Serious spells do three levels of effect, and cost four Fortune to cast.</li>
<li>Heroic spells do four levels of effect, and cost six Fortune to cast.</li>
</ul><p>Those trained in a particular Sphere of Magic can cast spells from that Sphere for two Fortune less than the above cost; so with training a Cantrip is free, a Simple spell is only two Fortune, etc.</p>
<p>Spells can only come from a single Sphere unless a Character has a Talent that allows them to combine two or more Spheres together into a single spell.</p>

<p>So a Cantrip Fire spell would be to set alight something the caster can see, a Simple spell would be to call forth a bonfire-sized fire, a Serious spell would call forth a house fire, and a Heroic spell would call forth a massive town-sized fire.</p>
<p>Some magic users have a special Talent that lets them combine together two or more schools into a single spell. So a Cantrip combined &ldquo;Fire Burst&rdquo; would be a firework-like small explosion, a simple one would be a small fireball, a serious one would be a ic &lsquo;fireball&rsquo; spell, and a heroic one would be a massive fire bomb.</p>

<p>Heroic - Magical, unique, really special, </p>
<h1 ="c15" id="h.m3y2g0o74c1d">< ="c18">Taking a Rest</h1><p>When the Players take a Rest between Encounters, each Player&rsquo;s Character can take two of the following actions:</p>
<ul ="c3 lst-kix_291ohs8hzv3v-0 start"><li>< ="c8">Loot. A Player can take time searching the immediate area for Loot, and/or try to determine the value and identify something they have looted prior.</li>
<li>< ="c8">Tell a Story. The Player tells a story, true or not, about their Character&rsquo;s past and/or people. Doing so regains two Fortune, and if it&rsquo;s a really good story, the DM may grant additional Fortune.</li>
<li>< ="c8">Recover. A Player can remove one level of Harm from their own or someone else&rsquo;s Character, if the Harm is one that could be reasonably dealt with by the Characters. So for example a Serious Harm becomes a Minor Harm, and a Minor Harm is fully removed.</li>
<li>< ="c8">Train. Training fills one pip on the advancement bar of the Player&rsquo;s choice.</li>
<li>< ="c8">Prepare. The player defines a future event they think may happen, and what they are doing to prepare for it, and earns one extra Fortune point to spend when that event happens.</li>
<li>< ="c8">Work on a project.&nbsp;The Player can advance any Clocks they may have regarding working towards a long-term project, or start a new long-term project.</li>
</ul><h1 ="c15" id="h.ygt14mdq3770">< ="c18">End of the Quest</h1><p>Once the Quest has been completed or abandoned, the players can count up Experience, Advance their Characters, Divy up the Loot, and earn Reputation.</p>
<h2 ="c19" id="h.2uckij4mu9sl">< ="c14">Experience</h2>
<p>Experience is given at the end of a Quest equally to all the Characters in the Party, and the Party itself, with the amount given depending upon the size of the Quest undertaken:</p>
<p>A Trivial Quest is just a single Encounter, and will give three Experience to every Player.</p>
<p>A Standard Quest is 2-3 Encounters, and will give five Experience to every Player.</p>
<p>A Serious Quest is 3-5 Encounters, and will give seven Experience to every Player.</p>
<p>A Heroic Quest is 5 or more Encounters, and will give nine Experience to every Player.</p>
<p>Additionally, ask these questions to the entire group (GM included), and for every Yes, add another Experience to the total given to every Player and the Party. If the group can&rsquo;t agree, put it to a vote instead:</p>
<ul ="c3 lst-kix_m5qst1z77yw-0 start"><li>Did we learn something new, interesting, and important about the world the Story is taking place in?</li>
<li>Did something really memorable happen and/or did someone tell an awesome story as part of play?</li>
<li>Did something significant happen to further the Party in its Party Quest?</li>
<li>Did something significant happen to further a Character&rsquo;s Personal Quest? </li>
</ul><p>Every point of Experience a Player gets can be spent to check the box of an Advancement Track. There are Advancement Tracks for each Attribute Group, a general track for unlocking new Talents, and an Advancement track for the Party itself that unlocks new bonuses and advantages the Party shares with all it&rsquo;s members.</p>
<p>Quests that were abandoned midway only count for half experience, and ones that were abandoned shortly after starting gain no experience at all.</p>
<p>So for example, a Party of four completes a Standard Quest. It had three big encounters in it, and something interesting and important was learned about the world, and it was memorable due to how much fun everyone had, but nothing about this Quest furthered a Character&rsquo;s Personal Goal or the Party&rsquo;s overall Goal. This gives us a total of seven Experience, which each of the four characters gets, and the Party itself gets as well. Each player decides where to spend their Experience, advancing different Tracks to their liking, unlocking new increases and improvements along the way. Finally the Party itself advances it&rsquo;s Party Advancement Track by seven Experience, possibly unlocking a new Party Advantage.</p>
<h2 ="c19" id="h.py5r1qo31pr7">< ="c14">Advancement</h2>
<p>Once Experience has been spent, if any Advancement Tracks have been filled, the Character can gain increases and improvements. </p>
<p>If an Attribute Group Track has been filled, the player zeros out the track, and then chooses an Attribute from that group to increase by +1. </p>
<p>If a Talent Track has been filled, the player zeros out the track, and then chooses a new Talent from their existing Trades, or start a new Trade (up to a maximum of three Trades at the same time).</p>
<p>If the Party Advancement Track has been filled, it&rsquo;s then zeroed out, and the group picks a new Party Advantage from the list, and the Party&rsquo;s Reputation increases a rank.</p>
<p>Note that due to Training, it&rsquo;s possible for a player to advance an attribute mid-Quest, but new Talents and Party Advancements can only happen at the End of the Quest.</p>
<h2 ="c19" id="h.y2xlsid7rdj8">< ="c14">Divy up the Loot</h2>
<p>After the Experience has been tabulated and distributed, and any Advancement taken, it&rsquo;s time to divide up the rewards from the Quest.</p>

<ul ="c3 lst-kix_l5n6mwk1cpun-0 start"><li ="c0 c12 li-bullet-0"></li>
<li>Experience and Advancement </li>
<li>Loot. The heroes receive their rewards from a successfully completed Quest and/or have time to study the treasures they looted</li>
<li>< ="c8">Reputation. The Party accumulates Reputation from the powers-that-be in the world as a result of their last Quest. Reputation is a two-edged sword.</li>
<li>Entanglements. The heroes face new troubles from their Party&rsquo;s new Reputation</li>
</ul><ul ="c3 lst-kix_l5n6mwk1cpun-1 start"><li ="c7 c17 li-bullet-0"><>High < ="c8">Reputation leads to some forces pulling them in to solve bigger problems and some forces challenging them to defeat them, but can be used by the Party to </li>

</ul><h1 ="c15" id="h.ei6v5hk26ki0">< ="c18">GM Guide</h1><p>Whenever the action has stopped, and the Players turn to you to find out what happens next, choose or randomly roll for one of the following:</p>
